Organizations today hold a lot of consumer data. This data can range from their names and email addresses to social security numbers and banking information. Although all of this data can be seen as an asset, there is a serious liability attached to them with respect to protecting this data. Privacy regulations such as the CCPA and GDPR require organizations to protect this data at all costs or risk facing fines for non-compliance.

Before we can dive into Sensitive Data Exposure, let's first look at what sensitive data is.

Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, whereas non-personal data includes elements that do not have identifiability and uniqueness to a person. Sensitive Data, on the other hand, is any data that reveals an individual's:

- Health data
- Biometric data
- Genetic data
- Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Religious, philosophical or political organization
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership and more

## What is Sensitive Data Exposure?

Sensitive data is anything that should not be accessible to unauthorized access, known as sensitive data. Sensitive data may include personally identifiable information (PII), such as Social Security numbers, financial information, or login credentials. Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when an organization unknowingly exposes sensitive data or when a security incident leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of, or access to sensitive data. Such data exposure may occur as a result of inadequate protection of a database, misconfigurations when bringing up new instances of datastores, inappropriate usage of data systems, and more.

## Types of Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive Data Exposure can be of the following three types:

1. **Confidentiality Breach**: where there is unauthorized or accidental disclosure of, or access to, sensitive data.
2. **Integrity Breach**: where there is an unauthorized or accidental alteration of sensitive data.
3. **Availability Breach**: where there is an unauthorized or accidental loss of access to, or destruction of, sensitive data. This will include both the permanent and temporary loss of sensitive data.

### Responsibility of Organizations

Organizations that collect sensitive data are responsible for its protection, and failure to do so can lead to heavy fines and penalties.

Let's take for example, the fines associated with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HIPAA and HITECH protect a patient's health data, and failure to do so can result in potential violations of up to **$1.5 million** in a year. Since these fines can continue to accumulate over the course of multiple years, this could accumulate to a large sum which can be disastrous for an organization’s growth plans.

To avoid such exorbitant amounts of fines, organizations must implement appropriate measures to protect the sensitive data of their customers and prevent any breaches.

### Difference Between Data Exposure & Data Breach
Before we move on, let's understand the difference between data exposure and data breach.

**Data Breach**:  
A data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals access sensitive information, often leading to data being compromised, stolen, or sold. Common causes include security flaws and human error, with methods such as malware, phishing, and brute-force attacks being frequently employed.

**Data Exposure**:  
Data exposure refers to the unintentional loss of sensitive information, typically due to inadequate protection or encryption. This can happen when data is mistakenly uploaded to the wrong database or when weak encryption allows easy access. Unlike breaches, exposure is often seen as a failure of the organization to safeguard its data, potentially harming its reputation.

## Ways in Which Sensitive Data Can Be Exposed

Data is vulnerable to exposure any time a company lacks security measures. Development and security teams must first have a clear understanding of the ways that data is vulnerable to exposure to improve mitigation techniques for potential application attacks, including:

### Data in Transit
Data is frequently in motion, transmitting instructions and requests via networks to other servers, programs, or people. Particularly when going across unprotected networks or through the application programming interface (API) that enables apps to communicate with one another, data in transit is extremely sensitive.

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, which intercepts traffic and keeps tabs on communications, is one attack that targets data in transit. Additionally, due to a flaw in SSL protocols, browser-side requests can be modified by code injection attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Data at Rest
A system, whether it be a computer or a network, houses data that is at rest. Without the threat of attacks, data at rest is believed to be more valuable but less vulnerable. Attackers use various methods to access stored data, frequently employing malicious software to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to data at rest.

Attackers might gain access to data stored in files outside of the usual authenticated areas of access if the data is kept on a server. As a result, there is a higher chance of a directory traversal or route traversal attack, in which access is gained to restricted locations on a system.

### How Applications are Vulnerable to Data Exposure
When a web application does not sufficiently safeguard sensitive information from being exposed to attackers, sensitive data exposure vulnerabilities can appear. Applications hosting information like credit card numbers, medical records, session tokens, or other authentication credentials are the most vulnerable.

It is frequently believed that neglecting to encrypt data is the most frequent error. The submission of a password in cleartext is one illustration of this vulnerability.

## Attacks That Expose Sensitive Data

Application attacks can expose sensitive data in a variety of ways. These consist of:

### SQL Injection Attacks
The most frequent application attack is SQL injection. A study claimed that application vulnerabilities that might be exploited cause most SQL injection attacks. An SQL injection attack involves hostile actors manipulating SQL requests to perform nefarious commands. Cybercriminals could effectively modify commands to access sensitive data if servers do not have a strong line of defense against identifying modified code.

Attackers may be given continued access to restricted portions of the application and be free to come and go as they want, depending on the severity of the command or request programmable into the malicious code injection.

### Network Compromise
All information is exposed when a network is compromised, especially when attackers maintain a continued but silent presence, for example, session hijacking.

A session is a period during which users are logged in and are identified by a unique session ID. Attackers who gain access to this ID have access to cookies that save user activity and login information across numerous websites. Bad actors can start assaults using an exploitable vulnerability, leaving little signs of exposure. Users risk having their sensitive data exposed or their identities stolen if cybercriminals are allowed to operate unnoticed.

### Broken Access Control Attacks
Applications and networks already have restrictions on what users can and cannot access. When this access is breached, users can gain authentication to locations outside these boundaries, some of which contain sensitive data.

### Ransomware Attacks
A form of virus known as ransomware encrypts files on the affected system. This malicious software is frequently integrated onto devices using an attachment or link that consumers assume to be from a reliable source. After clicking, ransomware downloads and decrypts data into unreadable code that hackers use to demand a ransom.

Attackers send emails requesting money or information in exchange for the decryption key they control. Attackers have access to all information stored on the computer system and are free to do with it whatever they want because they possess the decryption key.

### Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks frequently dupe users into thinking they are accessing or accessing a reliable website. Attackers disguise themselves as reputable businesses and frequently contact targets via email or text message.

Targets are tricked into divulging private information that criminals exploit to access their accounts and take their credit card information and other sensitive data.

### Insider Threat Attacks
Since insider threats typically include a current or former employee, they represent a danger that all firms must contend with. Anyone working for the organization with access to private information could start a data breach by breaking in and taking confidential data.

As businesses often stay occupied with attacks from outside sources and devote little time to establishing defenses against internal attacks, insider threat attacks and misuse of access frequently go unchecked.
## Key Takeaways:

### Risks of Holding Consumer Data
Organizations possess a vast amount of consumer data ranging from basic contact information to highly sensitive data like health records and financial information. While this data is valuable, it also poses significant liability risks, especially with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA requiring stringent data protection measures.

### Definition of Sensitive Data
Sensitive data encompasses any information that reveals personal attributes such as health status, biometric data, sexual orientation, political opinions, and more. This type of data requires higher levels of protection due to its nature.

### Sensitive Data Exposure Explained
Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when sensitive information is accessible to unauthorized parties, whether through inadequate data protection, misconfigurations, or security incidents. It can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability breaches, putting organizations at risk of heavy fines and penalties.

### Difference Between Data Exposure and Data Breach
Data exposure refers to unintended access to sensitive information due to inadequate protection, whereas a data breach involves unauthorized access through malicious attacks. Both have severe implications but differ in their mechanisms of occurrence.

### Vulnerabilities Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure
Data can be exposed during transit or while at rest due to inadequate security measures. Common attacks targeting sensitive data include SQL injection, network compromise, broken access control, ransomware, phishing, and insider threats.
