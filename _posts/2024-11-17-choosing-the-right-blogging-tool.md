When I decided to start this practical work, I believed that choosing a blogging tool would be simple. But as I explored different platforms, I realized that each comes with its own strengths, weaknesses, and learning curves. Here's my journey of exploring three popular blogging tools —Blogger, WordPress, and Jekyll—and how I landed on the one that worked best for me.
## Starting with Blogger: A Simple Yet Limiting Option

At first, I thought Blogger, Google’s CMS, would be the best option. It’s beginner-friendly, and I liked the idea of using a platform backed by Google. However, once I started building my blog, I quickly realized it lacked the flexibility I needed.

While it was easy to set up, I wasn’t satisfied with how the design and layout options matched my vision. The customization capabilities felt limited, and I struggled to make the blog look unique. As someone who values aesthetics and functionality, I knew I had to move on.
## Exploring WordPress: A Popular and Powerful CMS

Next, I turned to WordPress, the most widely used CMS. Everyone recommended it, so I thought it would be the perfect choice. After signing up, I spent 30 minutes finding a theme that matched the idea I had in mind. Finally, I found one I liked and began building my blog.

Since it was my first time using WordPress, I relied heavily on YouTube tutorials to understand the basics. However, I soon ran into roadblocks:

- I couldn’t edit the homepage the way I wanted.
- Plugins, a key feature of WordPress, required an upgrade to a paid plan (€4/month).
- The theme editor I needed wasn’t included in the free version.

I spent half a day troubleshooting, asking friends for advice, and searching for solutions. In the end, I realized I’d need to either upgrade to the paid version or compromise on my blog’s appearance and functionality. This left me frustrated, as my goal was to create a blog that matched my vision.

## Discovering Jekyll: Open-Source and Highly Customizable

Determined to find the perfect tool, I revisited my requirements to see other available blogging tools and stumbled upon Jekyll, a static site generator build in ruby language by github. Here’s why I decided to give it a try:

- **Open Source:** Unlike WordPress, there were no hidden costs,
- **Themes:** Jekyll offers a variety of free themes, and I found one called Chirpy that suited my needs perfectly.

Setting up Jekyll was challenging at first. It’s not as user-friendly as WordPress or Blogger, but I enjoyed the learning process. It required some knowledge of Markdown, Git, and a bit of coding, but the customization possibilities were endless. After experimenting and tweaking, I was able to build a blog exactly how I envisioned.

## Conclusion
Through trial and error, I learned that choosing a blogging tool depends on your priorities:

- If you’re a beginner looking for simplicity, Blogger is a good start.
- If you want a polished, feature-rich platform and are willing to pay, WordPress is a strong contender.
- For tech enthusiasts who enjoy customizing and learning new tools, Jekyll offers a rewarding experience.

In the end, my journey with Jekyll wasn’t just about creating a blog—it was about learning, experimenting, and building something I was proud of. If you’re someone who values control and customization, I highly recommend giving Jekyll a try.
